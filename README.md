# Purpose

The purpose of this project was to select an open source dataset and use the skills learned in our programming for data science class. I chose a dataset that I found on Kaggle called the [StockX Data Contest](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hudsonstuck/stockx-data-contest). The goal of this project was to predict the price of shoes on the aftermarket. For those who are not familiar, shoes like the Jordan 1's and Yeezy's go for a lot on the aftermarket. Usually, these shoes are bought instantaneously on websites (within 1 second), and thus go for a high price on the aftermarket because it's a matter of luck for the regular consumer. To attempt to predict the price of these shoes, I used linear regression.
